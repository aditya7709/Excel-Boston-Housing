Insights and Summary from the Boston Housing Dashboard
Key Observations:
Top 10 RM (Average Number of Rooms) Based on Total Price

The houses with more rooms (around 7–8 RM) tend to have higher total prices.
This indicates a strong positive correlation between RM and property value.
Highest Crime Rate (CRIM) by Median Value (MEDV)

The graph suggests that areas with lower median housing values tend to have higher crime rates.
As MEDV increases, CRIM decreases, showing an inverse relationship.
Distribution of Tax by Median Value (MEDV)

There is a wide distribution of tax values, with some properties experiencing much higher tax rates than others.
The relationship suggests that higher-valued homes might be subject to higher taxation.
Impact of Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTRATIO) on Median Housing Value (MEDV)

Higher PTRATIO is associated with lower median home values.
This indicates that areas with lower teacher-to-student ratios (better education systems) tend to have higher property prices.
Average Distance to Employment Centers (DIS) by Accessibility to Highways (RAD)

Areas closer to highways (lower DIS values) tend to have better accessibility but may also show lower housing values due to pollution and congestion.
Higher DIS suggests more suburban areas with possibly higher property values.
Top 10 Zones (ZN) by Total Price

Certain zoning areas (ZN) contribute significantly to total property prices, indicating prime real estate locations.
The top zones have high total property prices, suggesting greater development or desirability.
Industrial Land Proportion (INDUS) and its Impact on Housing Prices

Higher INDUS percentages seem to correlate with lower median housing values (MEDV).
This suggests that areas with more industrial land use tend to have lower housing prices due to environmental factors or less residential appeal.
Average TAX Paid by Property Owners (B) vs. LSTAT (Lower Status Population Percentage)

Areas with higher LSTAT (low-income population) tend to have higher taxes, possibly due to policy differences or economic factors.
More affluent areas (low LSTAT) may have a lower tax burden.
Summary and Recommendations:
✔ Higher RM (number of rooms) leads to higher property prices, making it a key selling point in the market.

✔ Crime rate (CRIM) is inversely related to property prices, suggesting investment in safer neighborhoods is more profitable.

✔ Better educational infrastructure (lower PTRATIO) correlates with higher property values, making school districts a key factor in real estate decisions.

✔ Proximity to industrial zones (INDUS) negatively impacts property values, indicating residential buyers prefer non-industrial areas.

✔ Zoning (ZN) and accessibility to highways (RAD) play a role in housing prices, impacting urban planning and development.

✔ Taxes and socio-economic factors (LSTAT) influence real estate affordability, indicating government policies play a role in housing market trends.# Excel-Boston-Housing
